# hello-world
My first repository

I am finally getting around to learning git by reading the information at the github.com site. I am making my first commit here on May 6, 2016.  I am a professor at Oregon Institute of Technology and working on installing Moodle and WebWork as well as making a bridge between the two awesome systems. 

Here goes my first commit!
